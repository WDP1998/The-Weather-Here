# The-Weather-Here
Based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw">Coding Train's<a> series which was based on Joey Lee's project <a href="https://github.com/joeyklee/the-weather-here">The Weather Here<a>.

If you want to use the project, get your own API key from the <a href="https://darksky.net/dev">Dark Sky Weather API<a>

Then, place your API key in the .env_sample file (where it says "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE").
Finally rename the .env_sample file to .env and you're good to go!
